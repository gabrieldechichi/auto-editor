## Spelling

The proper name of this project is auto-editor, capitalized as Auto-Editor.

> If the hyphen character is not allowed, spell it as AutoEditor or autoeditor.

Don't spell it as "Auto Editor" or "Auto-editor", as the former can be confused with preexisting terms, and the latter just looks off.


When referring to Auto-Editor's editing. Say "Auto-Editor's edits" or "Auto-Editor's cuts". Not as "the auto edits".


Don't use auto-editor as a verb. If you had your professional editor, Curt Miller start a new production. You wouldn't say to your co-worker, "Yeah, I Curt Millered a new video this morning".

BAD:
    I auto edited the video.
GOOD:
    I used auto-editor to edit the video.
